A queue is the ideal data structure for this task since it operates on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle — the earliest order placed gets processed first.
How it functions:

Enqueue: Append a fresh order (item + quantity) to the rear.
Dequeue: Remove the order from the front once completed.

Preventing issues:

Overflow: Implement a dynamic queue using a linked list.
Underflow: Always verify the queue isn’t empty before attempting removal.
Display orders: Output each order right after dequeuing to reflect the exact sequence of arrival.
